# what is JDBC and JDBC Drivers
-> JDBC (java Database Connectivity) is a java API for Connecting and interacting with databases. JDBC drivers are software components that provide the necessary functionality to connect java applications to different types of databases.

There are four types of JDBC drivers: 
1. JDBC - ODBC Bridge Driver
2. Native-API Partly java Driver
3. Network protocol pure java Driver
4. Thin Driver (Also known as the Direct to Database pure java Driver)

Each type of Driver has its own advantages and is suitable for different scenarios.


# JDBC components
 in addition to the JDBC drivers, there are several other components that make up the JDBC API, including: 

 * DriverManager Class
 * Connection interface
 * Statement and PreparedStatement interfaces
 * ResultSet interface

 These components work together to provide a powerful and flexible API for working with databases in java.


 # Program Flow
 1. Connect IDE with Database using necessary connector
 2. Load Necessary Drivers
 3. Create Connection
 4. Create Statement
 5. Execute Query
